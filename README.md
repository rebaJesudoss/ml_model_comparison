# Comparing ML models based on the Mean Absolute Error on a normalised data
In this project, a few ML models are compared for the Housing Prediction problem statement.

First, the dataset was checked for its normality using Kolmorgorov-Smirnov test. Later, it was normalised using MinMaxScaler.
For the prediction models, Multiple Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest were used. The MAE for each of these models was found and compared.

On comparison, Random Forest with a depth of 20 had the lowest error and performed fairly well.
